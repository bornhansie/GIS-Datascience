# GIS with Data Science
## This Repository will serve as a platform to explore the use cases for Data Science in GIS

### So lets get cracking and see how we can incorporate facets of machine learning, computer vision and more in depth EDA's to spatial data.
### At first we will use libraries such as rasterio(imagery) and geopandas(shapefiles) to first work with the spatial data.
